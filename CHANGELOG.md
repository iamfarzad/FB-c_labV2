All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Secure WebSocket Implementation - 2025-01-15

#### Security
- **HTTPS/WSS Protocol Upgrade**: Implemented secure WebSocket connections to resolve Mixed Content security errors
- Added SSL certificate support for local development using mkcert-generated certificates
- Upgraded server/live-server.ts to support both HTTP (production) and HTTPS (local development) protocols
- Updated client WebSocket URLs to use secure `wss://localhost:3001` connections
- Enhanced security compliance for HTTPS contexts preventing browser blocking of insecure connections

#### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Local development now requires SSL certificates (localhost.pem, localhost-key.pem)
- WebSocket server automatically detects environment and uses appropriate protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
- All client WebSocket connections now default to secure protocols (wss://)
- Port configuration: Production uses port 8080 (Fly.io), Local development uses port 3001
- Improved connection logging with protocol detection and security status

#### Fixed
- Resolved Mixed Content security errors in browsers when connecting to WebSocket server
- Fixed WebSocket connection failures in secure HTTPS contexts
- Enhanced cross-browser compatibility for secure WebSocket connections
- **ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL FIX**: Added missing `responseModalities: ['AUDIO', 'TEXT']` parameter to Gemini Live API configuration
  - This enables Gemini to respond with both audio (Puck's voice) and text (transcript)
  - Completes the full two-way voice conversation functionality
  - Resolves issue where audio was sent to Gemini but no responses were received

### Silero VAD Integration - 2025-08-06

#### Added
- **Advanced Silero VAD Integration**: Replaced custom voice recorder with professional-grade Silero Voice Activity Detection
- Neural network-based speech detection with configurable thresholds
- Automatic speech start/end detection using machine learning models
- Enhanced audio processing with 16kHz sample rate optimization
- Real-time volume visualization with Silero VAD feedback
- Comprehensive error handling for VAD initialization and operation

#### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Migrated VoiceInput component from `useVoiceRecorder` to `useSileroVAD`
- Improved voice detection accuracy and responsiveness
- Enhanced user interface with Silero VAD status indicators
- Updated toast notifications to reflect advanced VAD capabilities
- Better integration with WebSocket voice system

#### Technical Improvements
- Added `@ricky0123/vad-web` dependency for Silero VAD functionality
- Created `useSileroVAD` hook with configurable parameters:
  - `positiveSpeechThreshold`: Threshold for detecting speech (default: 0.5)
  - `negativeSpeechThreshold`: Threshold for detecting silence (default: 0.3)
  - `minSpeechFrames`: Minimum frames to consider as speech (default: 3)
  - `preSpeechPadFrames`: Frames to include before speech starts (default: 8)
- Proper cleanup and resource management for VAD instances
- TypeScript support with proper error handling

### Voice System Refactoring - 2025-08-06

#### Changed
- **useWebSocketVoice Hook Refactoring**:
  - Removed legacy `sendAudioChunk` function (was redundant wrapper)
  - Renamed `handleAudioChunk` to `onAudioChunk` for consistency
  - Renamed `handleTurnComplete` to `onTurnComplete` for consistency
  - Simplified public interface to only export necessary functions and state
  - Clean API now provides:
    - State: `session`, `isConnected`, `isProcessing`, `error`, `transcript`, `audioQueue`
    - Control Functions: `startSession`, `stopSession`, `sendMessage`, `playNextAudio`
    - Voice Recorder Callbacks: `onAudioChunk`, `onTurnComplete`

#### Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Improvements
- **Optimized silence detection parameters**:
  - Lowered silence threshold from 700ms to 500ms for better responsiveness
  - Reduced voice detection threshold from 0.005 to 0.002 for improved sensitivity
  - Added comprehensive debug logging for VAD decisions
  - Now properly sends TURN_COMPLETE signal when user stops speaking

#### Voice Recorder Integration Contract
- Established clear contract between `useVoiceRecorder` and `useWebSocketVoice`:
  - `onAudioChunk`: Called when voice recorder has audio data to send
  - `onTurnComplete`: Called when silence is detected (user finished speaking)
  - Ready for seamless integration in VoiceInput component
