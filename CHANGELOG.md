## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed
- **🚨 Critical: Fixed Broken Live API Session Management**
  - **Re-architected to WebSocket Server**: Replaced the non-functional, stateless HTTP-based Live API (`/api/gemini-live-conversation`) with a new, stateful WebSocket server (`server/live-server.ts`).
  - **Solved Session Leaks**: The new architecture ensures Gemini Live sessions are reliably created on client connection and destroyed on disconnection, completely resolving the massive resource leak issue.
  - **Stateful Connection**: Eliminated the "Controller is closed" errors by maintaining a persistent, stateful connection for the entire duration of the conversation.
  - **Reliable Turn Management**: Correctly handles `turnComplete` and conversation flow within a stable session.
  - **Dependencies**: Re-introduced `ws` for the WebSocket server and added `concurrently` to run the server alongside the Next.js app during development.

- **Simplified Client-Side Logic**:
  - Refactored `lib/gemini-live-service.ts` to use the WebSocket client instead of the unreliable `EventSource`/`fetch` combination.
  - Maintained the existing public interface, requiring only minimal changes in the `LiveVoiceModal.tsx` component.

### Removed
- **Obsolete API Route**: The fundamentally broken `/api/gemini-live-conversation/route.ts` is now deprecated and will be removed. The new WebSocket server completely replaces its functionality.
