## [Unreleased]

### Voice System Refactoring - 2025-08-06

#### Changed
- **useWebSocketVoice Hook Refactoring**:
  - Removed legacy `sendAudioChunk` function (was redundant wrapper)
  - Renamed `handleAudioChunk` to `onAudioChunk` for consistency
  - Renamed `handleTurnComplete` to `onTurnComplete` for consistency
  - Simplified public interface to only export necessary functions and state
  - Clean API now provides:
    - State: `session`, `isConnected`, `isProcessing`, `error`, `transcript`, `audioQueue`
    - Control Functions: `startSession`, `stopSession`, `sendMessage`, `playNextAudio`
    - Voice Recorder Callbacks: `onAudioChunk`, `onTurnComplete`

#### Voice Recorder Integration Contract
- Established clear contract between `useVoiceRecorder` and `useWebSocketVoice`:
  - `onAudioChunk`: Called when voice recorder has audio data to send
  - `onTurnComplete`: Called when silence is detected (user finished speaking)
  - Ready for seamless integration in VoiceInput component
