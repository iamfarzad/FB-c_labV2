### API Route (`app/api/ai/route.ts`)

- **Status**: ✅ **Implemented and Unified**
- **File**: `app/api/ai/route.ts`
- **Description**: This is now the single, unified API endpoint for all AI functionalities. It uses a `action` query parameter to route requests to the appropriate handler within `lib/ai/unified-ai-service.ts`.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Consolidated logic from older, separate API routes.
  - All incoming requests are validated using Zod schemas.
  - The `UnifiedAIService` handles the core business logic for each action.
  - Responses are standardized for both success and error cases.

### Chat Hook (`use-chat.ts`)

- **Status**: ✅ **Refactored**
- **File**: `app/chat/hooks/use-chat.ts`
- **Description**: The primary hook for managing chat state and interactions.
- **Key Changes**:
  - All `fetch` calls now target the `/api/ai` endpoint.
  - The `action` parameter is dynamically set based on the user's interaction (e.g., `conversationalFlow`, `generateImage`).
  - State management logic remains the same, ensuring UI consistency.
  - Error handling now processes the standardized error responses from the unified API.

### Test Plan

- **Objective**: Verify that all AI features work correctly through the unified `/api/ai` endpoint.
- **Execution**:
  - Use the `scripts/test-all-ai-functions.ts` script for automated testing.
  - Manually test the chat interface, ensuring all features (text, image, lead capture) are functional.
- **Example Test Command**:
  ```bash
  # Test conversational flow via the unified endpoint
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai?action=conversationalFlow \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"prompt": "Hello, AI!", "currentConversationState": {}}'

  # Test lead capture via the unified endpoint
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai?action=leadCapture \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"currentConversationState": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I am interested in your services."}]}}'
  ```

### Conclusion

The codebase review and subsequent fixes have successfully unified the AI backend under a single, robust API endpoint. This change simplifies the architecture, improves maintainability, and ensures that all AI functionalities are handled consistently. All identified issues have been resolved, and the system is now operating as expected.
