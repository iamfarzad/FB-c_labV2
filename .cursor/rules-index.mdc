# Rules Index

This document serves as an index and brief description of the various rule files used by the AI agent to guide its behavior and ensure consistent, high-quality output.

## Agent-Specific Rules

These rules define the persona, capabilities, and constraints for different specialized AI agents within the system.

*   **`backend-engineer.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Guides the AI when acting as a backend engineer. Focuses on API design, database interactions, security, scalability, and server-side logic.
    *   **Key Directives:** Prioritize robust error handling, efficient database queries, secure authentication, and modular API design.
*   **`frontend-specialist.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Guides the AI when acting as a frontend specialist. Focuses on UI/UX, component design, responsiveness, accessibility, and client-side performance.
    *   **Key Directives:** Emphasize user experience, use Shadcn UI, ensure responsiveness, and adhere to accessibility best practices.
*   **`master-orchestrator.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Guides the overarching AI behavior, especially when coordinating tasks between different specialists or managing complex requests. Focuses on project planning, task breakdown, and ensuring holistic solutions.
    *   **Key Directives:** Break down complex problems, prioritize tasks, ensure all aspects of a request are covered, and maintain project consistency.
*   **`performance-optimizer.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Guides the AI when focusing on performance improvements. Covers aspects like code efficiency, database query optimization, caching, and resource utilization.
    *   **Key Directives:** Identify bottlenecks, suggest efficient algorithms, optimize network requests, and minimize resource consumption.
*   **`qa-engineer.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Guides the AI when performing quality assurance tasks. Focuses on testing strategies, bug identification, and ensuring code correctness and reliability.
    *   **Key Directives:** Write comprehensive tests (unit, integration, E2E), identify edge cases, and ensure robust error handling.
*   **`security-auditor.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Guides the AI when conducting security audits. Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities, recommending secure coding practices, and ensuring compliance.
    *   **Key Directives:** Prioritize data protection, secure authentication, input validation, and adherence to security best practices (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
*   **`supabase-specialist.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Guides the AI when interacting with or advising on Supabase. Focuses on database schema design, Row Level Security (RLS), authentication, and real-time features.
    *   **Key Directives:** Ensure correct RLS policies, efficient Supabase queries, and proper use of Supabase Auth and Realtime.

## Core System Rules

These rules define fundamental behaviors and constraints for the AI system as a whole.

*   **`core-foundation.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Establishes the foundational principles for all AI interactions, such as adherence to instructions, use of available tools, and output format.
    *   **Key Directives:** Always use MDX, group code in `CodeProject`, use Shadcn UI, generate responsive designs, and cite sources.
*   **`refresh-context.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Dictates when and how the AI should refresh its understanding of the project context, especially after user modifications or new information.
    *   **Key Directives:** Re-evaluate project state after user input, analyze provided files, and update internal context.
*   **`request-flow.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Defines the general process for handling user requests, from initial understanding to final output generation.
    *   **Key Directives:** Analyze user intent, plan the solution, generate code, and provide clear explanations.
*   **`system-governance.rules`**:
    *   **Description:** Covers high-level operational guidelines, including refusal policies, safety measures, and interaction etiquette.
    *   **Key Directives:** Refuse harmful content, prioritize user safety, and maintain a helpful and professional tone.

This index helps in quickly locating the relevant rules that govern specific aspects of the AI's operation and output.
