# Stable Release Process

This document outlines the process for achieving stable releases of our application, ensuring high quality, reliability, and a smooth deployment experience.

## 1. Development Phase

*   **Feature Branching:** All new features, bug fixes, and improvements are developed on dedicated feature branches, branched off `main`.
*   **Code Reviews:** All code changes must undergo a thorough code review by at least one other developer. Reviews focus on:
    *   Code quality and adherence to coding standards.
    *   Correctness and functionality.
    *   Performance implications.
    *   Security vulnerabilities.
    *   Test coverage.
    *   Documentation updates.
*   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Developers write comprehensive unit and integration tests for their changes.
    *   Tests must pass locally before pushing to the remote.
    *   Minimum code coverage targets are enforced (e.g., 80%).
*   **Local Testing:** Developers perform thorough local testing of their features.

## 2. Pre-Merge Phase

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Execution:** Upon pushing to a feature branch, the CI/CD pipeline automatically runs:
    *   **Linting & Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint checks.
    *   **Type Checking:** TypeScript compilation.
    *   **Automated Tests:** Unit, integration, and E2E tests.
    *   **Security Scans:** Dependency vulnerability scans.
    *   **Compliance Checks:** Automated checks against backend architecture compliance checklist.
*   **E2E Tests:** Critical end-to-end user flows are tested using Playwright.
    *   These tests run against a staging environment or a mocked environment (for AI interactions).
*   **Visual Regression Tests:** (If implemented) Visual tests ensure UI changes do not introduce unintended visual regressions.
*   **Documentation Updates:** All relevant documentation (README, API docs, design docs, changelog) is updated.

## 3. Staging Deployment

*   **Automated Staging Deployment:** Once all CI/CD checks pass and code review is approved, the feature branch is merged into a `develop` or `staging` branch. This triggers an automated deployment to a dedicated staging environment.
*   **Manual QA & User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    *   The QA team performs comprehensive manual testing on the staging environment.
    *   Key stakeholders and product owners conduct UAT to ensure features meet business requirements.
    *   Any bugs or issues found are reported and prioritized for immediate fixes.
*   **Performance Testing:** Load and stress tests are conducted on staging for critical paths.
*   **Security Audits:** (Periodic) Manual security audits or penetration tests are performed on the staging environment.

## 4. Release Candidate (RC) Creation

*   **Branching for RC:** Once UAT is complete and all known critical bugs are resolved on staging, a release candidate branch (e.g., `release/vX.Y.Z`) is created from `develop`/`staging`.
*   **Final CI/CD Run:** The RC branch undergoes a final, full CI/CD pipeline run.
*   **Zero Known Critical Bugs:** No critical or high-priority bugs should exist in the RC.

## 5. Production Deployment

*   **Approval:** Deployment to production requires explicit approval from product owner and engineering lead.
*   **Automated Production Deployment:** The RC branch is merged into `main`. This triggers an automated deployment to the production environment (e.g., Vercel production deployment).
*   **Monitoring & Rollback:**
    *   Immediate post-deployment monitoring of logs, performance metrics, and error rates.
    *   A clear rollback plan is in place in case of critical issues.
    *   Vercel's instant rollbacks are leveraged.
*   **Announcement:** Communicate the new release to relevant internal and external stakeholders.

## 6. Post-Release Monitoring & Feedback

*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Ongoing monitoring of production environment for performance, errors, and security.
*   **User Feedback:** Collect and analyze user feedback for continuous improvement.
*   **Incident Response:** Follow the incident response plan for any production issues.

This structured release process ensures that only thoroughly tested and validated code reaches production, minimizing risks and maximizing application stability.
