# Backend Architecture Compliance Checklist

This checklist ensures that our backend architecture adheres to security, performance, scalability, and maintainability best practices. It should be reviewed at key stages of development and before deployment.

## I. Security Compliance

*   **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   [x] All API endpoints require authentication unless explicitly public.
    *   [x] JWTs are used for session management, with proper signing and expiration.
    *   [x] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented for sensitive operations.
    *   [x] Admin routes are protected by a dedicated admin authentication middleware.
    *   [x] User passwords are never stored in plain text (use bcrypt or similar hashing).
    *   [x] Rate limiting is applied to authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.

*   **Data Protection:**
    *   [x] All sensitive data is encrypted at rest (database, file storage).
    *   [x] All data in transit is encrypted (HTTPS/TLS 1.2+).
    *   [x] Input validation and sanitization are performed on all incoming data to prevent XSS, SQL injection, etc.
    *   [x] SQL queries use parameterized statements or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
    *   [x] Environment variables for secrets are properly managed and not hardcoded.
    *   [x] Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) is correctly configured and enforced for all sensitive tables.

*   **API Security:**
    *   [x] API endpoints are protected against common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
    *   [x] CORS policies are correctly configured to allow only authorized origins.
    *   [x] Sensitive information is not exposed in API responses (e.g., stack traces, internal errors).
    *   [x] Proper error handling is implemented to avoid information leakage.

*   **Logging & Monitoring:**
    *   [x] Security-relevant events (login attempts, access denials) are logged.
    *   [x] Logs are stored securely and are accessible for auditing.

## II. Performance & Scalability Compliance

*   **Database Optimization:**
    *   [x] Database queries are optimized (e.g., proper indexing, efficient joins).
    *   [x] N+1 query problems are identified and resolved.
    *   [x] Connection pooling is used for database connections.
    *   [x] Supabase Realtime is used judiciously to avoid over-fetching or unnecessary subscriptions.

*   **API Efficiency:**
    *   [x] API responses are optimized for size (e.g., only return necessary data).
    *   [x] Caching strategies are implemented where appropriate (e.g., Redis, CDN).
    *   [x] Asynchronous processing is used for long-running tasks (e.g., background jobs, queues).
    *   [x] AI model selection is optimized for cost and performance based on feature requirements.

*   **Scalability:**
    *   [x] Stateless API endpoints where possible.
    *   [x] Services are designed for horizontal scaling.
    *   [x] Load balancing considerations are in place.
    *   [x] Serverless functions are used for burstable or event-driven workloads.

## III. Maintainability & Reliability Compliance

*   **Code Quality:**
    *   [x] Code adheres to established coding standards (ESLint, Prettier).
    *   [x] Comprehensive unit and integration tests are written for critical logic.
    *   [x] Code is modular and follows separation of concerns.
    *   [x] Clear and concise documentation for complex modules and APIs.

*   **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    *   [x] Graceful error handling for all API endpoints.
    *   [x] Circuit breakers or retry mechanisms for external service calls.
    *   [x] Robust logging for debugging and operational insights.
    *   [x] Monitoring and alerting are configured for critical errors and performance deviations.

*   **Deployment & Operations:**
    *   [x] Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles are followed (e.x. Vercel config).
    *   [x] CI/CD pipelines are configured for automated testing and deployment.
    *   [x] Rollback procedures are defined and tested.
    *   [x] Environment-specific configurations are managed securely.

*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   [x] Dependencies are regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities and performance improvements.
    *   [x] Dependency versions are pinned to ensure consistent builds.

## IV. AI-Specific Compliance

*   **Model Management:**
    *   [x] AI model versions are tracked and managed.
    *   [x] Model inputs and outputs are logged for auditing and debugging.
    *   [x] Mechanisms for A/B testing or gradual rollout of new models.

*   **Cost Management:**
    *   [x] Token usage is tracked and logged for all AI interactions.
    *   [x] Budget enforcement mechanisms are in place for AI API calls.
    *   [x] Cost-effective models are prioritized where appropriate.

*   **Ethical AI:**
    *   [x] Considerations for bias, fairness, and transparency are integrated into AI development.
    *   [x] Data used for AI training is ethically sourced and compliant with privacy regulations.
    *   [x] Human oversight is considered for critical AI-driven decisions.

This checklist is a living document and will be updated as our architecture evolves and new best practices emerge.
