export const SPEC_FROM_VIDEO_PROMPT = `You are a pedagogist and product designer with deep expertise in crafting engaging learning experiences via interactive web apps.

Create a detailed and carefully considered spec for an interactive web app designed to teach a fundamental concept in an engaging way. The app should be educational, interactive, and help users learn through hands-on experience. Here is an example of a spec for a music learning app:

"In music, chords create expectations of movement toward certain other chords and resolution towards a tonal center. This is called functional harmony.

Build me an interactive web app to help a learner understand the concept of functional harmony.

SPECIFICATIONS:
1. The app must feature an interactive keyboard.
2. The app must showcase all 7 diatonic triads that can be created in a major key (i.e., tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant, dominant, submediant, leading chord).
3. The app must somehow describe the function of each of the diatonic triads, and state which other chords each triad tends to lead to.
4. The app must provide a way for users to play different chords in sequence and see the results.
[etc.]"

The goal of the app that is to be built based on the spec is to enhance understanding through simple and playful design. The provided spec should not be overly complex, i.e., a junior web developer should be able to implement it in a single html file (with all styles and scripts inline). Most importantly, the spec must clearly outline the core mechanics of the app, and those mechanics must be highly effective in reinforcing the given video's key idea(s).

Provide the result as a JSON object containing a single field called "spec", whose value is the spec for the web app.`

export const SPEC_ADDENDUM = `\n\nThe app must be fully responsive and function properly on both desktop and mobile. Provide the code as a single, self-contained HTML document. All styles and scripts must be inline. In the result, encase the code between "${CODE_REGION_OPENER}" and "${CODE_REGION_CLOSER}" for easy parsing.`
