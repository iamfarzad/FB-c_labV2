# Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues

### âœ… 401 Authentication Error in Chat
**Issue**: Website chat was returning 401 "Authentication required" errors.

**Root Cause**: The chat API was requiring user authentication even for anonymous public chat access.

**Solution**: Modified the authentication logic in both `/api/chat` and `/api/chat-enhanced` to allow anonymous access while maintaining security for admin features.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated authentication flow to generate anonymous user IDs when no auth token is provided
- Removed strict authentication requirement for public chat functionality
- Maintained authentication for admin and sensitive endpoints

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

```bash
# Copy the template
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Critical Variables to Set

1. **GEMINI_API_KEY** (Required for chat functionality)
   - Get from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Without this, chat will return "Service configuration error"

2. **OPENAI_API_KEY** (Optional, for enhanced features)
   - Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

3. **RESEND_API_KEY** (Optional, for email features)
   - Get from: https://resend.com/api-keys

### Vercel Deployment

1. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. The Supabase configuration is already hardcoded in the project files, so no additional setup needed.

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Test chat API (should not return 401)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

### Production Testing
1. Visit your deployed website
2. Navigate to the chat page
3. Send a message - should work without requiring login
4. Check browser dev tools - no 401 errors should appear

## Security Notes

- Anonymous chat access is safe because it doesn't access sensitive data
- Admin endpoints still require proper authentication
- Rate limiting is in place to prevent abuse
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized

## Troubleshooting

### "Service configuration error"
- Check that `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in your environment
- Verify the API key is valid and has proper permissions

### Still getting 401 errors
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check that the latest code is deployed
- Verify no middleware is interfering with the API routes

### Chat not responding
- Check server logs for API key issues
- Ensure rate limits aren't being exceeded
- Verify Supabase connection is working
