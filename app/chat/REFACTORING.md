# Chat Page Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring work done on the chat page to improve maintainability and code organization.

## Overview

The chat page has been refactored from a single large component (`page.tsx`) into smaller, more manageable components. The new structure follows React best practices and makes the code easier to maintain and test.

## New Structure

```
app/chat/
├── components/
│   ├── chat/
│   │   ├── ChatInput.tsx     # Chat input area with file upload
│   │   ├── ChatMessage.tsx   # Individual message component
│   │   └── ChatMessages.tsx  # Messages container
│   ├── Sidebar/
│   │   ├── ActivityLog.tsx    # Activity feed in sidebar
│   │   ├── DesktopSidebar.tsx # Desktop sidebar component
│   │   ├── MobileSidebar.tsx  # Mobile sidebar component
│   │   └── SidebarContent.tsx # Shared sidebar content
│   └── index.ts              # Barrel exports
├── constants/
│   └── chat.ts               # Constants and configuration
├── context/
│   └── ChatContext.tsx       # Chat state management
├── hooks/
│   └── useFileUpload.ts      # File upload logic
├── types/
│   └── chat.ts               # TypeScript types
└── utils/
    └── chat-utils.ts         # Utility functions
```

## Key Changes

1. **Component Extraction**
   - Split the monolithic `page.tsx` into smaller, focused components
   - Created reusable UI components following the atomic design methodology
   - Separated concerns between presentation and business logic

2. **State Management**
   - Implemented React Context for global state management
   - Created custom hooks for reusable logic
   - Moved complex state logic out of components

3. **Type Safety**
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for all props and state
   - Improved type safety throughout the application
   - Created a centralized types file for shared types

4. **Performance**
   - Implemented memoization where appropriate
   - Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
   - Lazy-loaded non-critical components

## How to Use

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

### Adding New Features

1. **New Component**
   - Create a new file in the appropriate directory under `components/`
   - Export the component from `components/index.ts`
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for props

2. **New Hook**
   - Create a new file in the `hooks/` directory
   - Follow the `useSomething` naming convention
   - Document the hook with JSDoc comments

3. **New Utility Function**
   - Add to `utils/chat-utils.ts` or create a new utility file
   - Add TypeScript types for parameters and return values
   - Write unit tests for the utility function

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Deployment

The refactored code is ready for deployment. The new structure is compatible with the existing deployment pipeline.

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Implement error boundaries
- Add loading states and skeleton loaders
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Add more accessibility features
