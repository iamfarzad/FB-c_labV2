Every decision we make, big or small, shapes our relationships and defines our character. This interactive experience challenges you to navigate various situations, making choices that demonstrate unwavering commitment and build trust. Your goal is to consistently choose actions that uphold your promises and avoid those that could break trust, aiming for the highest possible \\\"Commitment Score.\\\"\\n\\n**Core Mechanics:**\\n\\n1.  **Scenario Presentation:** The app will display a series of distinct, relatable scenarios, each describing a situation where a commitment (explicit or implicit) is tested.\\n2.  **Choice Selection:** For each scenario, the user will be presented with two clear choices: one that upholds the commitment and one that breaks it.\\n3.  **Immediate Feedback:** Upon selecting a choice, the app will provide immediate textual feedback describing the outcome of that choice.\\n4.  **Commitment Score:** A visible \\\"Commitment Score\\\" will track the user's progress. Upholding a commitment increases the score, while breaking one decreases it. The goal is to maximize this score across all scenarios.\\n\\n**SPECIFICATIONS:**\\n\\n1.  **Overall Structure:** The entire application must be contained within a single HTML file. All CSS styles should be embedded directly within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`, and all JavaScript logic within a `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag.\\n\\n2.  **User Interface (UI) Elements:**\\n    *   **Header:** A prominent and clear title for the app: \\\"The Commitment Compass.\\\"\\n    *   **Introduction Text:** An initial paragraph explaining the premise of the app (as provided in the \\\"Introduction\\\" section above).\\n    *   **Commitment Score Display:** A clearly visible `<span>` or `<div>` element that continuously displays the current \\\"Commitment Score\\\" (e.g., \\\"Commitment Score: 0\\\"). This should be updated in real-time as choices are made.\\n    *   **Scenario Display Area:** A dedicated `<div>` or `<p>` element to present the text of the current scenario.\\n    *   **Choice Buttons:** Two distinct buttons for each scenario. One button will be labeled for the \\\"Uphold Commitment\\\" action, and the other for the \\\"Break Commitment\\\" action. These buttons should be clearly distinguishable.\\n    *   **Feedback Display\n\nIMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:\n\n1. **Modern shadcn/ui Design System**: Use a clean, modern design inspired by shadcn/ui with:\n   - Clean typography (Inter or similar font)\n   - Subtle shadows and rounded corners\n   - Neutral color palette (slate/gray tones)\n   - Proper spacing and padding\n   - Modern button styles with hover effects\n\n2. **Component Styling**: Style components to match shadcn/ui patterns:\n   - Cards with subtle borders and shadows\n   - Buttons with proper hover and active states\n   - Form inputs with focus rings\n   - Clean, minimal icons (use Unicode symbols or simple SVG)\n   - Consistent spacing using 4px grid system\n\n3. **Color Scheme**: Use a professional color palette:\n   - Background: #ffffff or #f8fafc\n   - Text: #0f172a (primary), #64748b (secondary)\n   - Borders: #e2e8f0\n   - Primary: #3b82f6 (blue)\n   - Success: #10b981 (green)\n   - Warning: #f59e0b (amber)\n\n4. **Interactive Elements**: Include engaging components:\n   - Buttons with smooth transitions\n   - Cards with hover effects\n   - Progress indicators\n   - Form elements with validation\n   - Tabs or accordion sections\n\n5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app works on all devices with:\n   - Mobile-first approach\n   - Flexible layouts using CSS Grid/Flexbox\n   - Proper touch targets (44px minimum)\n   - Readable typography at all sizes\n\nThe app must be fully responsive and function properly on both desktop and mobile.

This interactive web app, 'The Concept Connection Challenge,' is designed to help learners solidify their understanding of a central concept by actively identifying and connecting its core components to their corresponding roles or definitions.\\n\\nSPECIFICATIONS:\\n\\n1.  **Central Display Area:**\\n    *   At the top of the screen, a prominent, clearly labeled box will display the 'Main Concept' (e.g., 'The Water Cycle', 'Photosynthesis', 'Supply and Demand'). This concept serves as the anchor for the entire activity.\\n    *   Below the Main Concept, there will be a designated 'Workspace' area, visually divided into two main sections: the 'Component Bank' and the 'Target Slots' area.\\n\\n2.  **Component Bank:**\\n    *   Located on one side of the 'Workspace' (e.g., the left side), this area will contain a list of individual terms, phrases, or potentially small images (referred to as 'Components'). These Components represent sub-ideas, stages, elements, or key vocabulary related to the Main Concept.\\n    *   Each Component in the bank must be a distinct, draggable element.\\n    *   The order of Components in the bank should be randomized each time the app loads or resets, to prevent rote memorization of positions.\\n\\n3.  **Target Slots Area:**\\n    *   Located on the opposite side of the 'Workspace' (e.g., the right side), this area will contain several distinct 'Target Slots.'\\n    *   Each Target Slot will display a description, role, definition, or a related sub-concept that accurately corresponds to one of the Components from the Component Bank.\\n    *   These Target Slots will function as drop zones for the draggable Components.\\n\\n4.  **Core Mechanics - Drag-and-Drop Matching:**\\n    *   The user's primary interaction is to drag Components from the Component Bank and drop them onto what they believe is the correct Description/Target Slot.\\n    *   **Immediate Visual Feedback:** Upon dropping a Component onto a Target Slot, the app must provide instant feedback:\\n        *   **Correct Match:** The Component 'snaps' into place within the Target Slot, becoming visually fixed (e.g., changing its background color to green, displaying a small checkmark icon, or simply remaining in the slot). The Component should no longer be draggable from that slot.\\n        *   **Incorrect Match:** The Component should visually indicate an incorrect placement (e.g., briefly flash red, display an 'X' icon, or bounce back to its original position in the Component Bank). This allows the user to immediately correct their understanding.\\n    *   Users should be able to try different combinations until all Components are correctly matched.\\n\\n5.  **Completion and Reinforcement:**\\n    *   Once all Components are correctly matched to their respective Target Slots, a clear 'Success' message should appear prominently (e.g., 'Excellent! You've successfully connected all the concepts!', 'Great Job!').\\n    *   Optionally, upon successful completion, the app could briefly highlight the correct pairings or present a simplified, static summary of the complete concept map.\\n\\n6.  **Reset Functionality:**\\n    *   A 'Reset' button must be prominently displayed, allowing the user to clear all placed Components and return them to the Component Bank (in a new random order), enabling them to restart the activity at any time.\\n\\n7.  **Data Structure (for Developer Implementation):**\\n    *   The content for the app (Main Concept, Components, and their corresponding Descriptions/Target Slots) should be easily configurable by the developer. This should be achieved via a simple JavaScript object or array defined directly within the HTML file's `<script>` tag.\\n    *   An example structure could be:\\n        ```javascript\\n        const conceptData = {\\n            mainConcept: \\\"Photosynthesis\\\",\\n            elements: [\\n                { component: \\\"Chlorophyll\\\", description: \\\"The green pigment that absorbs light energy.\\\" },\\n                { component: \\\"Carbon Dioxide\\\", description: \\\"A gas absorbed from the atmosphere, used as a raw material.\\\" },\\n                { component: \\\"Water\\\", description: \\\"Absorbed by roots, a key reactant in the process.\\\" },\\n                { component: \\\"Light Energy\\\", description: \\\"The primary energy source that drives the reaction.\\\" },\\n                { component: \\\"Glucose\\\", description: \\\"The sugar produced as food for the plant.\\\" },\\n                { component: \\\"Oxygen\\\", description: \\\"A gas released as a byproduct.\\\" }\\n            ]\\n        };\\n        ```\\n    *   The app should dynamically render the Component Bank and Target Slots based on this data, ensuring that the Components are initially presented in a shuffled order.\\n\\n8.  **Design and Implementation Constraints:**\\n    *   The entire application must be implemented within a single HTML file. All CSS styles should be embedded inline within a `<style>` tag, and all JavaScript logic within a `<script>` tag.\\n    *   The design should be clean, intuitive, and visually appealing, utilizing simple colors, clear typography, and sufficient spacing to ensure readability and ease of interaction.\\n    *   All interactions (dragging, dropping, feedback) should feel smooth and responsive, contributing to a playful and engaging user experience.\\n    *   No external libraries, frameworks, or build tools (e.g.,\n\nIMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:\n\n1. **Modern shadcn/ui Design System**: Use a clean, modern design inspired by shadcn/ui with:\n   - Clean typography (Inter or similar font)\n   - Subtle shadows and rounded corners\n   - Neutral color palette (slate/gray tones)\n   - Proper spacing and padding\n   - Modern button styles with hover effects\n\n2. **Component Styling**: Style components to match shadcn/ui patterns:\n   - Cards with subtle borders and shadows\n   - Buttons with proper hover and active states\n   - Form inputs with focus rings\n   - Clean, minimal icons (use Unicode symbols or simple SVG)\n   - Consistent spacing using 4px grid system\n\n3. **Color Scheme**: Use a professional color palette:\n   - Background: #ffffff or #f8fafc\n   - Text: #0f172a (primary), #64748b (secondary)\n   - Borders: #e2e8f0\n   - Primary: #3b82f6 (blue)\n   - Success: #10b981 (green)\n   - Warning: #f59e0b (amber)\n\n4. **Interactive Elements**: Include engaging components:\n   - Buttons with smooth transitions\n   - Cards with hover effects\n   - Progress indicators\n   - Form elements with validation\n   - Tabs or accordion sections\n\n5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app works on all devices with:\n   - Mobile-first approach\n   - Flexible layouts using CSS Grid/Flexbox\n   - Proper touch targets (44px minimum)\n   - Readable typography at all sizes\n\nThe app must be fully responsive and function properly on both desktop and mobile.
