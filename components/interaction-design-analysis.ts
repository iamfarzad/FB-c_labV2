/**
 * Interaction Design Analysis
 *
 * Feedback & Affordance:
 * ✅ Clear visual feedback for interactive elements
 * ✅ Loading states for async operations
 * ❌ Some actions missing confirmation dialogs
 *
 * Animations & Transitions:
 * ✅ Smooth transitions between states
 * ✅ Purposeful animations that enhance UX
 * ✅ Respect for reduced motion preferences
 * ❌ Some animations too lengthy
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * ✅ Clear error messages
 * ✅ Graceful error recovery
 * ❌ Some error states lack recovery actions
 *
 * Progressive Disclosure:
 * ✅ Complex features revealed progressively
 * ✅ Good use of tooltips and popovers
 * ❌ Some tooltips lack delay timing
 *
 * Consistency:
 * ✅ Consistent interaction patterns
 * ❌ Some inconsistent behavior between similar components
