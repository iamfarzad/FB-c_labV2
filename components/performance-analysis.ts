/**
 * Performance Analysis
 *
 * Initial Load:
 * ✅ Proper code splitting
 * ✅ Dynamic imports for heavy components
 * ❌ Some large dependencies not code-split
 *
 * Runtime Performance:
 * ✅ Efficient re-renders with proper hooks usage
 * ❌ Some unnecessary re-renders in complex components
 * ❌ Large lists not virtualized
 *
 * Asset Optimization:
 * ✅ Proper image optimization with Next.js
 * ✅ SVG usage for icons
 * ❌ Some unoptimized images
 *
 * Memory Management:
 * ✅ Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
 * ❌ Some potential memory leaks in modal components
 *
 * Network Efficiency:
 * ✅ Proper API request batching
 * ❌ Some redundant API calls
