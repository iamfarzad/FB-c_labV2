/**
 * UI/UX Architecture Analysis
 *
 * Component Structure:
 * ✅ Follows atomic design principles with atoms, molecules, organisms
 * ✅ Clear separation between UI components and business logic
 * ✅ Consistent naming conventions across components
 * ✅ Proper use of composition over inheritance
 *
 * State Management:
 * ✅ Context API used appropriately for global state
 * ✅ Local component state for UI-specific concerns
 * ✅ Proper prop drilling avoidance
 * ❌ Some components have excessive prop passing
 *
 * Code Organization:
 * ✅ Logical folder structure separating concerns
 * ✅ Consistent file naming conventions
 * ✅ Proper code splitting for performance
 * ❌ Some components could benefit from further modularization
 *
 * Performance Considerations:
 * ✅ React.memo used for expensive renders
 * ✅ useCallback/useMemo for optimized functions/values
 * ❌ Some components re-render unnecessarily
 * ❌ Large component trees could benefit from virtualization

// Recommendations for improvement
export const architectureRecommendations = [
  "Implement React.memo for ChatMain component to prevent unnecessary re-renders",
  "Extract message rendering logic into separate component",
  "Create a dedicated hook for modal state management",
  "Implement virtualized list for chat messages to improve performance with large message history",
  "Standardize prop interfaces across related components",
