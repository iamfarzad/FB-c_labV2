/**
 * Modal Implementation Analysis
 *
 * Accessibility:
 * ✅ Proper focus management
 * ✅ ARIA roles and attributes
 * ❌ Some modals missing proper focus trapping
 *
 * User Experience:
 * ✅ Clear open/close animations
 * ✅ Proper backdrop handling
 * ❌ Some modals have awkward mobile layouts
 *
 * Implementation:
 * ✅ Consistent implementation using Radix UI primitives
 * ✅ Portal usage for proper stacking
 * ❌ Some modals have redundant code
 *
 * Performance:
 * ✅ Lazy loading for heavy modal content
 * ❌ Some modals not cleaned up properly on unmount
