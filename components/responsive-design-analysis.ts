/**
 * Responsive Design Analysis
 *
 * Viewport Handling:
 * ✅ Proper meta viewport tag
 * ✅ Use of responsive units (rem, em, %)
 * ✅ Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
 *
 * Breakpoint System:
 * ✅ Consistent breakpoint system using Tailwind
 * ✅ Logical breakpoints for different device sizes
 * ❌ Some hardcoded pixel values instead of using theme breakpoints
 *
 * Layout Adaptability:
 * ✅ Flexible layouts using Flexbox/Grid
 * ✅ Proper stacking on smaller screens
 * ❌ Some overflow issues on very small screens
 *
 * Touch Targets:
 * ✅ Sufficiently sized touch targets on mobile (min 44x44px)
 * ❌ Some buttons too small on touch devices
 *
 * Media Features:
 * ✅ Support for dark mode
 * ✅ Support for reduced motion
 * ❌ Missing print styles
