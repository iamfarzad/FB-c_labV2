My Journey: From Global Storytelling to Building AI That Lasts

After 17 years creating and producing TV shows, documentaries, commercials, and music videos for major networks and brands across Europe, the Middle East, and the US, I found myself at a crossroads. I’d traveled the world—from the slums of India and the Philippines to high-tech companies in South Korea and China, and lived in places like Los Angeles and Dubai. I met high achievers in government and entertainment, and told stories that reached millions.

But over time, I grew tired of creating visual content that disappeared in seconds or minutes. I wanted to build something lasting—tools that actually help people and stand the test of time.

In 2020, I launched my first startup, Optix.io, and dove headfirst into the world of technology and AI. It was a hard reset: I had no formal tech background, and the journey was full of frustration, dead ends, and learning the hard way. I broke things, rebuilt them, and learned by doing—starting with GPT-2 and riding the wave of exponential AI growth that followed.

Since then, I’ve tried every approach in the book, from no-code tools to deep coding, and discovered what really works (and what’s just noise). My philosophy: you have to build and break things yourself to truly understand them. That’s how I’ve grown—from creative director to hands-on AI builder and consultant.
